# 🏧ATM (Automated Teller Machine)

🧑‍💼ATM Management System (Beginner Friendly).

  An ATM Management System is like a smart machine that helps people do money stuff at banks without needing to
  talk to a person. You can take out cash or check how much money you have, and you don't need a person like a 
  cashier to help you. It's all done electronically.
